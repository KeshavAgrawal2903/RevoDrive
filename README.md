## üì± Usage Requirements

### Location Services
- Enable browser location access
- Grant location permissions when prompted
- Ensure device location services are active

Browser-specific settings:
- **Chrome**: Settings > Privacy and Security > Site Settings > Location
- **Firefox**: Settings > Privacy & Security > Permissions > Location
- **Safari**: Preferences > Websites > Location

### Troubleshooting

#### Location Detection
- Verify browser location permissions
- Check device location services
- Try a different browser if issues persist
- For local development:
  - Some browsers restrict geolocation on non-HTTPS connections
  - Consider using a local HTTPS server
  - Manual location input is available as fallback

#### API Key Issues
- Confirm Mapbox token is public
- Verify token has geocoding permissions
- Check token scope and restrictions
